Machine Learning Fundamentals

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed for every task.

Key Concepts:
1. Supervised Learning: Learning from labeled data to make predictions
2. Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in data without labels
3. Reinforcement Learning: Learning through interaction with an environment

Popular Algorithms:
- Linear Regression
- Decision Trees
- Neural Networks
- Support Vector Machines
- Random Forest

Applications:
- Image Recognition
- Natural Language Processing
- Recommendation Systems
- Fraud Detection
- Autonomous Vehicles

Machine learning is revolutionizing industries by enabling data-driven decision making and automation of complex tasks.
